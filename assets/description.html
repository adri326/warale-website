<h1>Warale the Ageless Elder</h1>

is a <a href="https://bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> community/bloodline fort, organized on the unofficial Dwarf Fortress <a href="https://discord.gg/CvAEMWx">Discord Server</a>.

<p>
    The community fort started in February 2020 (in-game year 170) and is still running as of July 2021 (recently passing in-game year 215).
</p>

<p>
    The first fort in the bloodline's world (Camade Asada, Realm of Vision) is <em>Warale the Ageless Elder</em>.
    It was then followed by a "museum" fort, using <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=176070.0">DFPlex</a>, which was not saved.
    A second museum fort was then created, also named Warale the Ageless Elder, on a northern island.
    Lastly, a new fort, <em>Mischiefsteel</em>, was created in the in-game year 199 on the southeast of the mainland; it is the current fort.
